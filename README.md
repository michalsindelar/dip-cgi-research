Own project.

_Heartbeat detection and visualization from video source._

This project is an application, which detects heartbeat frequency of sampled person based on short optical record and figures the heartbeat in eye-catching form to the user. Creating algorithm for detecting the heartbeat is needed for this thesis purpose. Figuring the heartbeat frequency is inspired by Eulerian Magnification in records.
