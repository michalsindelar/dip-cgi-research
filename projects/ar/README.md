# Augmented Reality research

+  In the late of 2017 I invested time to research in Augmented Reality especially on ARKit and related technologies such as:

    +  Machine Learning based [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)
    +  Unity ARKit plugin (developing applications in Unity game engine using capabilities of ARKit)


+  All the research was covered by subjects on my Alma Mater [FI MUNI Brno](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) in subjects [PA198](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2017/PA198) and [PV160](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2017/PV160)
